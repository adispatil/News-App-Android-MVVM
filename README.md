# News-App-Android-MVVM

This is a Android app. Mostly asked as a assignment task in many IT companies. I tried to figure out the solution for intermediate level developers.

I have covered below points in this app. 
* Kotlin
* MVVM
* Dependency Injection - Kodin
* Data binding
* View binding
* Retrofit
* Recycler View
* Adapter binding
* Gson
* Picasso
* Room database
* Observables
* Live data
* Offline data sync
* Handled network error

I have used news api to get the latest news from India. You can change the location easily.
